# Contact Data Cleaner

This utility uses LLM (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini) to clean and normalize job titles, company names, and infer job categories from scraped LinkedIn profiles.

## Problem

LinkedIn scraping often produces messy data:
- Job Title: `"Recruiting at Notion - We're Hiring! Notion.so/careers"`
- Company: `"Notion 路 Contract"`
- Category: Unknown

## Solution

The LLM automatically cleans this to:
- Job Title: `"Recruiter"`
- Company: `"Notion"`
- Category: `"Recruiter"`

## Usage

### Configuration

Set the OpenAI API key in your environment:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

If the API key is not set, the cleaner will log a warning and return the original (uncleaned) values.

### In Code

```javascript
const { cleanContactData, cleanContactInfo } = require('./utils/contact-cleaner');

// Clean individual fields
const cleaned = await cleanContactData(
  "Recruiting at Notion - We're Hiring! Notion.so/careers",
  "Notion 路 Contract"
);
// Returns: { jobTitle: "Recruiter", company: "Notion", category: "Recruiter" }

// Clean a contact info object
const contactInfo = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  jobTitle: "Engineering at Google 路 Full-time",
  company: "Google | Mountain View"
};
const cleanedInfo = await cleanContactInfo(contactInfo);
// Returns: { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", jobTitle: "Software Engineer", company: "Google", category: "Software Engineer" }
```

## Integration Points

The contact cleaner is automatically integrated into:

1. **Email Sending** (`routes/email.js`)
   - Cleans contact data when an email is sent

2. **Manual Contact Creation** (`routes/contacts.js`)
   - Cleans data when creating contacts via POST /api/contacts

3. **Apollo Email Search** (`routes/contacts.js`)
   - Cleans data from Apollo API before persisting

4. **CSV Import** (`scripts/import-apollo-csv.js`)
   - Cleans data during bulk imports from Apollo CSV exports

## Performance

- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini (fast and cost-effective)
- **Latency**: ~200-500ms per contact
- **Cost**: ~$0.0001 per contact
- **Fallback**: Returns original values if API fails

## Error Handling

The cleaner is designed to never break contact creation:
- If OpenAI API is unavailable, it returns original values
- If the API key is missing, it logs a warning and returns original values
- If JSON parsing fails, it returns original values
- All errors are logged for debugging

## Available Categories

The LLM can infer these standardized categories:
- **Recruiter** - Recruiting roles
- **Software Engineer** - Software engineering roles
- **Product Manager** - Product management roles
- **Designer** - Design roles
- **CEO** - Chief Executive Officer
- **Founder** - Founders
- **Co-Founder** - Co-founders
- **Data Scientist** - Data science roles
- **Analyst** - Analyst roles
- **Consultant** - Consulting roles
- **University Recruiter** - Campus/university recruiting
- **Talent Acquisition** - Talent acquisition specialists
- **Other** - Roles that don't fit standard categories

## Example Transformations

| Input Job Title | Cleaned Title | Cleaned Company | Inferred Category |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `"Recruiting at Notion - We're Hiring!"` | `"Recruiter"` | `"Notion"` | `"Recruiter"` |
| `"Software Engineering 路 Full-time"` | `"Software Engineer"` | - | `"Software Engineer"` |
| `"Product Manager at Google"` | `"Product Manager"` | `"Google"` | `"Product Manager"` |
| `"Senior UX Designer"` | `"Senior UX Designer"` | - | `"Designer"` |
| `"Data Scientist at OpenAI"` | `"Data Scientist"` | `"OpenAI"` | `"Data Scientist"` |
| `"Co-Founder & CEO"` | `"Co-Founder & CEO"` | - | `"Co-Founder"` |
| `"Campus Recruiter at UCLA"` | `"Campus Recruiter"` | `"UCLA"` | `"University Recruiter"` |
